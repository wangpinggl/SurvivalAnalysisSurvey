# Machine Learning for Survival Analysis: A Survey
This repository summarizes important materials related to the survey paper about
[Machine Learning for Survival Analysis: A Survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3214306). In the survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the statistical methods typically used and the machine learning techniques developed for survival analysis, along with a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and describe several successful applications in a variety of real-world application domains. We hope that this article will give readers a more comprehensive understanding of recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines for applying these approaches to solve new problems arising in applications involving censored data.
